# MemoryPlatformGame_Unity
This is a small experimental game about memory and orientation. The player must reach the finish while the environment periodically switches between light and dark spikes, so the player has to rely on memory. The game includes teleport, hidden mechanics, and an additional ending, encouraging exploration and learning through repetition
